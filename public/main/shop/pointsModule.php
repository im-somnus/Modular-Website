            <h1>Point system</h1>
            <p>Point system was designed in a way so that users can exchange their in-game earned points for rewards</p>
            
            <p>Points can either be earned in-game by playing, completing missions, questing, beating challenges, etc. They can also be bought through the donation system.</p>
            <p>We don\'t like <b>P2W</b> games, so in order to avoid falling into that trap, all the rewards you can buy with real life money will not give any advantage whatsoever.</p>
